"settleDyn" is a Haskell program, which provides a command line interface, and
it uses the Bullet Physics Library for the collision detection.

__Outline__  To compile settleDyn one needs a Haskell compiler together with
libraries.  These are for example packaged in Haskell Plattform found under
http://hackage.haskell.org/platform.  The current version is tested with Glasgow
Haskell Compiler version 7.0.2.  The extra libraries needed by settleDyn are
listed in the cabal configuration file and will be installed automatically by
the Haskell's package manager cabal.

The Bullet Physics Library (http://www.bulletphysics.org) must be installed
before compiling the Haskell sources. Many Linux distributions have already a
precompiled package; alternatively one compiles it following instructions on the
Bullet's web site.

The Haskell Plattform is available besides Linux also for Windows and Mac OS.
After installing Bullet Physics Library the installation procedure is the same
with only difference in path names.

__Step by step intsruction__:
 -    Install Bullet Physics Library either as package in your linux
      distribution or build it from sources.
 -    Install Haskell Plattform.
 -    In the top directory of settleDyn (containing the settleDyn.cabal file)
      run 'cabal install'. The missing libraries required by settleDyn should be
      downloaded and installed automatically by cabal.
 -    At the end of compilation there will be a line saying where the executable
      is installed to, usually
      "Installing executable(s) in /home/user/.cabal/bin".
 -    A short test 'settleDyn -p data/sphere.off -n 10 -o /tmp/test' should
      generate a new directory /tmp/test containing resulting grain files in
      .off file format and a statistics.txt file.

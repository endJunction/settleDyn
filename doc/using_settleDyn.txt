Introduction
------------

The simulation process can be described as "throwing grains in a sandbox."
Only grains can be controlled by command line arguments, while the sandbox
dimensions are fix.  This does not reduce the diversity of porous media, which
can be generated.

__The sandbox__ is constrained by ground plane with top at z = 0 (z is the
vertical coordinate) centered in the origin.  The four walls of the sandbox are
100 units high and placed 7 units to each side of origin.  The resulting
simulation volume is -7 to 7 in x and y directions and from 0 to maximum of 100
units in the vertical.  All units are arbitrary, one can always rescale the
resulting porous media.

When further processing the porous medium one would usually like to avoid any
boundary effects (equally placed grains along the walls and on the ground
plane), and would select only grains contained e.g. in 10x10x10 cube centered at
(0, 0, 10).  This is the reason why the walls' positions were choosen as above.
The sandbox dimensions cannot be altered by command line arguments.

__Grain generation__ is controlled by grains' shapes, their grain size
distribution and "throw in" placement.

_The grain shapes_ must be convex polyhedra described in Geomview Object File
Format (.off). The shapes to be used in the simulation are specified by
the '-p filename.off' command line argument. There can be arbitrary many input
shapes but at least one is required, because there is no "default" shape.

Using multiple grain shapes allows to control their fractions in the resulting
porous media. In the simulation it is uniformly drawn from all available shapes.
Specifying two spheres and one cube as input would generate 2/3 of spheres and
1/3 of cubes approximately.

_Grain size distributions_ are usually given in mass per cent, but for the
simulation it is easier to specify them in number of groins. There are three
distributions implemented. The simplest are the univariate and bivariate
distributions. Many of the grain size distributions of sands can be approximated
with Weibull distribution (see your favorite statistics book on this subject)
which is also implemented.

depends on two coefficients, the slope and mean. We also give a lower
bound for grains' sizes
and this results in shifted Weibull distribution.

The command line arguments controlling the grain size distribution are '-d' with
possible values 'univariate', 'bivariate' or 'weibull', and the arguments '-k',
'-l' and '-m' which specify the numerical parameters of chosen distribution.
The univariate distribution uses only the '-m' argument.  The bivariate
distribution uses the '-l' and '-m' arguments for the minimum and maximum values
respectively. The Weibull distribution is specified by all three arguments '-k',
'-l' and '-m' for the slope, mean and minimum respectively.

To create grains drawn from bivariate distribution with size 1/2 and 1 give
'-d "bivariate" -l 0.5 -m 1' as command line arguments.
To create grains drawn from weibull distribution with minimum sizes 1/2 the mean
approximately at 3/4 with slope 3, give '-d "weibull" -k 3 -l 0.5 -m 0.75' as
command line arguments. The default distribition is the univariate distribution
and requires only the '-m' parameter to be given on the command line.

This is all to kind of grains constructed in the simulation. The rest of of the
introduction covers the grain placement and the remaining command line
arguments, and can be skipped in the first reading.

_Placement_  The grains are generated in a square with dimensions -b to b in x
and y directions.  '-b' is the corresponding command line argument.  The height
of the generated grains is computed from the height of the already settled
grains plus offset.  The offset is specified by '--offset' argument and should
be a non-negative value.  The height of the settled grains is maximum height of
non-moving grains', where there is a velocity threshold controlled by '-t'
argument.

_Generation rate_  The velocity threshold argument also controlls when new
grains are generated.  Together with '-n' argument, which specifies the maximum
number of moving grains, the generation rate can be controlled.

Grain generation stopps when maximum number of grains is reached, set by the
'-n' argument. Or, when maximum height of settled grains is reached. This is
controlled by the '-h' command line argument.

An additional parameter '-f' is controlling, when non-moving grains are frozen.
This can be helpful, when large number of grains are genereted in the
simulation. Freezing grains after they are not moving specified number of
simulation steps will make them static objects and reduce the number of degrees
of freedom of the sediment.

__Finishing simulation__  The simulation finishes when all grains are settled
down.  Then it saves all grains in their current position to the 'out/'
directory by default. One can specify another output directory with '-o path'
argument.

Alternatively one can specify number of simulation steps with '-s' argument.


Examples
--------

The following command line arguments describe common scenarios.

*One grain shape (prototype.off) with constant size 1.23.*  Setting the grain
size minimum and mean to same values result in only one grain size.

> settleDyn -p prototype.off -m 1.23

*One grain shape with Weibull-distributed grain sizes with mean 1.0 and minimum 0.5*
Let the slope parameter k of the Weibull distribution be 3.0 (default value),
then the mean of the non-shifted distribution is
mu = l * Gamma(1 + 1/k) ~= l * 0.89338
and of the shifted it is
minimum + mu ~= 0.5 + l * 0.89338,
which should be 1.0, i.e. l ~= 0.55967.

> settleDyn -p prototype.off -d "weibull" -m 0.5 -l 0.55967

The variance of the non-shifted Weibull distribution is
sigma^2 = L^2 (Gamma(1+2/k) - Gamma^2(1+1/k)). In this example it is
sigma ~= 0.18

*Two shapes (s1.off, s2.off) of constant size 1.0 containing 25% of first and
75% of the second shape.* Specify the second shape three times.

> settleDyn -p s1.off -p s2.off -p s2.off -p s2.off -m 1

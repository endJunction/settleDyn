Description
-----------

"settleDyn" is a sedimentation process simulator.  It is capable of generating
loose sand-like structures from given particle forms and statistical
distributions.

This software is a complete rewrite of the Settle3D program written by Guido
Blöcher. See corresponding paper for further details:
    Blöcher, G. and Zimmermann, G. 2008. Settle3D-A numerical generator for
      artificial porous media. Comput. Geosci. 34, 12 (Dec. 2008), 1827-1842.

The complete sedimentation process including diagenesis involves many processes
on variing time and space scales. The first step in sandstone formation is
deposition of grains. This process can be simulated with current software.
Cementation and further compactification or any other diagenetic processes
cannot be simulated with settleDyn.

Simulation process starts with definition of grain shapes and grain size
distributions. The shapes are polyhedral descriptions read from files in
Geomview Object File Format (.off). For now, only convex shapes are allowed.

After the simulation is finished, the grains in their current positions are
written to specified directory, again in the .off format.


Requirements
------------

This code is written in Haskell and uses the Bullet Game Physics Engine Library
for collision detection. In order to compile this program you will need:
 - Bullet Physics Library (http://bulletphysics.org)
 - Haskell e.g. Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)
   (http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/)
 - Various package dependencies given in the .cabal file.
